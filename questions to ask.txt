1)About Keyboard handler which is better to have an independent keyboardhandler that do not know about the bomber-> the code in bomber increases
OR should I make it as in SpaceInvaders?

2)Direction? should I add a state like direction???







Note:
If I want the bomb to be oval I need to check the if the tostring of the block is equal to the "bomb block" and then make it gray and make the oval inside the grect
