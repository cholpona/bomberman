=========

Bomberman game 

This game is implemented in Java.
The main class is in BomberGame class.
So far this game has a primitive gui, and bombermen goes around and puts bombs. The logic of the bomb is being implemented. The enemy is also to be implemented. After all logic part will be done and primitive gui will work I will try to extend this project to a better gui with images, if time will allow.
